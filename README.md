## Genetic programming is the mad science of breeding software. 
### How do you do it, you ask?

- Step 1: Give a thousand monkeys a thousand typewriters
- Step 2: Check to see if they wrote anything that looks like useful Clojure code (according to some fitness function)
- Step 3: Breed the most successful monkeys with each other (also do genetic modifications, expose the monkeys to radiation, etc)
- Step 4: GOTO Step 2

**Disclaimer:** *No real monkeys were harmed in the making of this library.*
